# Basic orderbook simulation

Based of ideas from BristolStockExchange ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.06027.pdf , https://github.com/davecliff/BristolStockExchange )

Build a simple simulator. Basic exchange structure, abillity to submit orders. Then build the complexity by having random agents trade. Build a model on top of this.
